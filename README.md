# Machine learning for drug screening
Supporting information for the paper "Discovery of RIPK1 inhibitors by machine learning and molecular dynamics simulations"
In this study we used four machine learning models to predict the active molecules in the Zinc database on RIPK1. 
Through a series of correlation analyses as well as dynamics simulations,
we finally identified six molecules with promising potential for targeting RIPK1 and interpreted the models by SHAP method, 
which will provide some constructive suggestions for the development of RIPK1 inhibitors.
